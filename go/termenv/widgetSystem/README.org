This is my hobby attempt to build up TEA based TUI library by my self for practice.
If you want to need something like this, [[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea][charmbracelet/bubbletea]] is a good one.

** Purpose of this module
+ Practice usage of channels/goroutines
+ Just wanted to make my own TUI library because I've used a lot before
  + e.g. [[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea][charmbracelet/bubbletea]] for golang, [[https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/][jtdaugherty/brick]] for haskell

** Non-purpose of this module
+ Provide stable & good experience
+ For serious usage
+ Constant updates
+ Clever implementation design
  + I want to do so as far as I can, but it's not my main goal
