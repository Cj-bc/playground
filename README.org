* playground

This is _my_ playground.
There're some practical codes/tools.

** Code quality isn't guaranteed; Do not expect "Good code" here
All codes here are not planned to be maintained. Even I acknoledge
that [[https://github.com/Cj-bc/playground/security/dependabot][dependabot]] have alerted me a lot of problems, I'm not going to
fix them because those codes here aren't used anymore.
