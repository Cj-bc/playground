* playground

This is _my_ playground.
There're some practical codes/tools.


** What're here?

I commit:

+ Some tiny codes came to my mind
+ Implementation of some sort of standards(e.g. RFC, IEEE)
+ Some ideas that isn't grown enough to make new repository for it
+ Tiny programs written to get familiar to framework, library, or programming language itself

As I commit "some ideas that isn't grown enough yet", I sometimes pick them up
and create dedicated repository for them.

** Code quality isn't guaranteed; Do not expect "Good code" here
All codes here are not planned to be maintained. Even I acknoledge
that [[https://github.com/Cj-bc/playground/security/dependabot][dependabot]] have alerted me a lot of problems, I'm not going to
fix them because those codes here aren't used anymore.

* Directory structure
Basically, codes are stored in individual directories based on used language/framework.
So [[haskell]] contains haskell programs, [[go]] contains golang one, and so on.
However, if the program satisfies one of requirements listed below are stored in [[project]] directory:

+ program is composed from several languages (e.g. contains both server-side and client-side)
+ I want to/or plan to write the same program with several other languages(e.g. trying to implement RFC in several languages)
